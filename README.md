# Shoot-it-

'Shoot it' is a simple game with different mechanics. 

As a player we are able to collect money in order to buy something in shop. You can purchase a new skin, additional heart, key which is able to open every door or a new attack. 

Moreover, in game we can meet with enemies, which are able to follow us and shoot if we come too close! So shoot them first if you would like to explore map! But don't worry, if you died you will respawn after a few seconds in the safe place. Beware of spikes on the ground! If you touch them your health will decrise. 

Collect keys in order to get to another map! 

We can pause game whenever we like.
